    <h2><center>ABOUT THE TEAM:</center></h2>
    <p>
      Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) is a franchise cricket team that represents the city of Bangalore (now called
      Bengaluru) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team was founded in 2008 and is owned by United Spirits, a
      subsidiary of the British alcoholic beverages company Diageo. It was named after the company's liquor brand Royal
      Challenge. The Bangalore franchise was purchased by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6 million for it.

      The team's home ground is the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, which has a seating capacity of around 35,000.
      The team's logo is a red lion with a golden mane, and its jersey is predominantly red with black and gold accents.

      RCB has had some big-name players in its squad over the years, including Indian cricketing legend Rahul Dravid, as
      well as current Indian captain Virat Kohli, and South African batting sensation AB de Villiers. RCB has set
      records for both the highest and lowest totals in the IPL, scoring 263/5 as their highest score, and 49 as their
      lowest score. The team has also had some famous coaches, including Gary Kirsten and Daniel Vettori.

      Despite being one of the most popular teams in the IPL, RCB has had a mixed record in the tournament, having
      finished runners-up on three occasions (2009, 2011, and 2016) but failing to win the title so far. However, the
      team has a reputation for playing an exciting brand of cricket and has some of the most loyal fans in the
      tournament.

      Rahul Dravid was the captain of RCB in the first three seasons of the IPL, from 2008 to 2010. RCB finished
      runners-up in the 2009 IPL, losing to Deccan Chargers in the final. It was their best performance in the
      tournament under Dravid's captaincy. Dravid was known for his calm and composed captaincy style, and he was
      respected by his teammates and opponents alike.Although Dravid did not have a lot of success as RCB's captain in
      terms of trophies, his leadership helped build the foundation of the team, and his contribution to RCB's journey
      in the IPL has been significant.

        of RCB since 2013, and under his leadership, the team has had brilliant results in the IPL. Virat remains one of
        the most popular and successful captains in the IPL, and his leadership has played a crucial role in RCB's
        performances over the years.

        seasons. He is the only batsman to have scored more than 500 runs in three consecutive seasons (2015-2017) and

        his team from the front has made him a fan favorite and an inspiration for aspiring cricketers all over the
